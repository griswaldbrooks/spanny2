## spanny2 improvements
- [ ] Upload cad files to printables
    - [ ] Revise cad to be fully printable without supports
    - [ ] Make easier to assembly
- [ ] Design and make boards
- [ ] Make BOM
- [ ] Make assembly instructions
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Make youtube videos
    - [ ] ie, make 5 minute videos on each of the examples and pieces of the talk
- [ ] Add include what you use

## mdspan examples
- [ ] Molton/zed curve
- [ ] Fractal for Jason
- [ ] Zoom into area 

## spanny3 ideas
Add unit tests
Benchmark
Add costmap layers where  multi layer pixels are more local
Real path planner
Segment anything... plus voxels?
The laser scans and polygonal should be transformable after instantition...?
Try to write more constexpr and compile time code
Don't return an mdspan
frameless torque motors
simplefoc
need automatic joint calibration routine, even with magnetic position encoders
index of mdspan representing a state, returning a set of next states
what would happen if you extended mdspan to accept an std::dextents<double, 3> (doesn't compile)
